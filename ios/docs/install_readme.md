## How to build

If you'd like to build Open Mobile Maps yourself, make sure you have all submodules initialized and updated. To do this, use

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Updating Djinni bridging files

The bridging interface between Kotlin and C++ are defined in the djinni files under [djinni](../djinni). After modifying those files, the new bridging code can be generated by running

```make clean djinni```

in the folder [djinni](../djinni). This generates the Kotlin bindings, the C++ header files as well as all the Objective C glue code.

### Building the iOS Package.

The [Package.swift](../Package.swift) file can be opened in Xcode and build directly from there. 

### iOS 10

Unfortunately, Swift package is only supported starting with iOS 11. If you need iOS 10 support you have to compile the library as a framework yourself.
